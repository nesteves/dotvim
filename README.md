# dotvim

A repository meant to store my vim configuration, inspired by vimcast's
[post](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/).

Includes a .vimrc config file, pathogen and the following plugins:

* [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - file system explorer
* [NERDTree Tabs](https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs) - persist NERDTree
  across file tabs
* [NERDTree git](https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin) - git status
  flags for NERDTree
* [Colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes) - colorscheme
  manager
